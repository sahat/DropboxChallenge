# Dropbox Challenge [![Code Climate](http://img.shields.io/codeclimate/github/sahat/DropboxChallenge.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/sahat/DropboxChallenge)

This a quick over-the-weekend project as part of a take-home interview problem
from **Dropbox**. Kudos to them for making such an exciting interview project. 
I haven't had this much fun coding since I was working on the 
[New Eden Faces](https://github.com/sahat/newedenfaces) project.

## Getting Started

[Download](https://github.com/sahat/DropboxChallenge/archive/master.zip) and 
extract the project. Then run the following commands from within that directory
to install dependencies and start a local web server:

```bash
bower install
npm install
gulp server
```

**Note:** Local web server is necessary in order to avoid security policy errors 
with *LinkedIn JavScript SDK*.
